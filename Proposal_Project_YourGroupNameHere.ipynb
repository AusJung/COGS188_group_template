    "# Abstract \n",
    "The goal of our project is to develop an AI agent that is able to beat the game of PacMan autonomously. The agent will be responsible for navigating through a provided maze with the goal of optimizing the amount of pellets collected while avoiding the ghosts. The data that we would use would be the environment of the game including the layout of the maze, pellets that represent the rewards of the game, and more. More specifically, we will be using OpenAI Gym to provide a simulated training environment for our project. We will employ AI algorithms to train the AI agent to make decisions based on different game states. The chosen algorithm should minimize the time spent playing the game and avoid terminating the game (avoiding colliding with ghosts). We will measure the success of the AI agent during the game based on the following metrics: speed of completion, wins and losses, and number of pellets collected if lost. \n"

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Pac-Man is a retro video game where the goal is to navigate through a maze-like environment, while collecting pellets for points and evading the enemy ghosts. Since the creation of the game, many people have tried their hardest to collect all of the pellets the fastest, and in recent years, this retro game has become a playground to test different AI algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Various AI algorithms have been tested on the original retro arcade, and some researchers[1] have determined A* search is the optimal solution. Although the article[1] explores many of the different algorithms, it does not delve into the experimental setups or real-time feasibility. Rather, it reads as more like explaining the optimal solutions to navigating the map.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another group of researchers[2] explored the effectiveness of the Monte Carlo Search Tree when controlling Ms. Pac-Man, particularly when working in real time. The article[2] specifically focused on real-time strategies, specifically using < 40 ms decision making to simulate a real game, and determined that using this algorithm created a strong competitive agent in gathering points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the OpenAi Gym[3], this blogger showed how to set up an environment to instruct the agent, using a random search. Although Gupta’s work primarily focuses on the random search rather than AI, it serves as a valuable resource in setting up the environment to work on implementing our own algorithms."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Our team’s objective is to implement an AI algorithm taught in class, and tune it to the retro arcade game Ms. Pac-Man. We want the algorithm to control the agent Ms. Pac-Man, which will evade the ghosts and collect the pellets scattered around the map.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initial State: The map with all of the pellets in position, Ms. Pac-Man at the starting position (centered horizontally and slightly shifted down vertically), and all of the ghosts in the enclosure.\n",
    "- Players: Only 1 player, which is Ms. Pac-Man.\n",
    "- Actions: At every cell, the possible legal moves are going left, right, up, down, and no action. Even when there is a wall at the potential move, the action of Ms. Pac-Man will still turn towards that direction.\n",
    "- Result: The new state of the map, which typically consists of Ms. Pac-Man facing a new position and/or moving along the directed path, along with the removal of pellets from the new cell Ms. Pac-Man is on. Finally, this also results in any changes the random actions of the ghosts have.\n",
    "- Terminal Test: The game ends (reaches terminal state) when either all the pellets have been collected or when the ghosts reach pacman.\n",
    "- Utility: The final outcome will be the total number of pellets collected. So the lower the score, the less pellets that were collected before death, with the maximum score being that all pellets are collected."
